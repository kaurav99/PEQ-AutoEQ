# AutoEQ-to-PEQ

This repository contains a collection of parametric EQ (PEQ) files converted from the AutoEQ GitHub repository by Jaakko Pasanen. All the PEQ files here can be readily imported into the HiByMusic Player app for an enhanced music listening experience.

AutoEQ is a project for equalizing headphone frequency responses automatically and it achieves this by parsing frequency response measurements and producing equalization settings which correct the headphone to a neutral sound.

## Visual Sound Profiles

Here are a few examples of sound profiles you might come across in the PEQ files:

*Flat EQ profile, which aims to produce a balanced sound across all frequencies.*

*Bass Boost profile, for those who prefer a more bass-heavy sound.*

*Vocal Boost profile, emphasizing the frequencies commonly associated with vocals.*

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the desired PEQ files.
2. Import the PEQ file(s) into your HiByMusic Player app.
3. Apply the imported PEQ preset to your headphones in the app settings.

Note: Each PEQ file is named according to the headphone model it corresponds to.
